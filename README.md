node server that proxys restbase

## Endpoints

`/raw/[title]`

`/slim/[title]`

## Dev

`node index.js`

Running the server with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), i.e.
`nodemon` (or `nodemon index.js`), eases the development experience by clearing
the cache whenever the process is restarted.
